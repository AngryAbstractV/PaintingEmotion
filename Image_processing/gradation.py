"""
    Gradation is based on change of colors or density throughout an image. The program uses Sobel Filter, 
    already provided by OpenCV. We take the x, y sobel filter scores and create a magnitude of both scores.
    We take the first channel from the magnitude score and modulo it until it matches the other scores.
    We then take the inverse because Sobel detects edges, which is the opposite of gradation
